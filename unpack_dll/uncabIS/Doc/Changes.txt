Changes by Morlac - 27/Dec/2000
-------------------------------

1- is6cab.h
   Added password to tagCABHEADER -- still not sure about its size limit --
   Its a non-encypted string(dont know about the future though).
   Not needed for i6comp but for those who want
   to work with iscabvu.exe from installshield corp. take a look at
   offset 0x54 of data1.hdr
   
   Added Component status as a bitfield                 -- typedef struct tagCompStatus --		    
   Added Component attributes as a bitfield             -- typedef struct tagCompAttr --    
   Added FileGroup Overwrite attributes as a bitfield   -- typedef struct tagFG_overwrite --
   Modified FileGroup attributes to BitFields           -- typedef struct tagFG_Attrs --
   Found that "struct tagSETUPTYPEHEADER" is part of struct tagSETUPTYPEDESC
   	modified "struct tagSETUPTYPEDESC" to include a struct of the above
   	as a member.
 

2- i6comp.c

  a) Added verbose option mostly for debugging and evaluation.
     -v activates it.

  b) ListComponents() modified to display all known info about components??
     Any ideas about COMP_ATTR_******* There seems to be other used bits but
     couldnt figure out what they mean.
     - Need to test with password protected and encypted packages.
     Use -v for the additional info.
   
  c) ListFileGroups() has been modified to display all known info about filegroups.
     Use -v for the additional info.
   
  d) ListSetupTypes() modified to display setup components as well if in verbose
     mode. Now i can say that this func is complete.
     Use -v for the additional info.
   
  e) CabBasedFileList() modified.
     -f (treat filegoups as directories) when used with commands 'e' and 'x'
     extract files to their FileGroup directories. Letters '<>' are mapped to
     '[]'. When used with command 'l' adds the filegroup to the path.
     Note that a pure filegroup will have a index of -1.
   
  f) Fixed a bug when passing anything other than data(%d).(%s) as a cabinet name.
     Now passing data.cab will be taken as data1.cab
     
  g) ListFiles() modified.
     i6comp l -f data1.cab "file.ext" will no longer display all file groups.
     Only info about that file will be displayed.
     
  h) small errors that i introduced.
   
NOTE:
   Dont use '\' followed by nothing in filegroup names. Causes problems for commandline
   parsing done by windows for some reason.
   ie. "<Engine>SelfRegistering\" wont work but"<Engine>SelfRegistering\*" works
   fine. Am i missing something about commandline parsing?
